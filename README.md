# Todo List Feed Feature Specs

---

### Story: Customer requests to see the todo list feed

---

### Narrative #1

As an online customer
I want the app to load tasks from the network only on the first launch
So that I can initialize my todo list and cache tasks for future offline use

#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria):

1. **On the first launch with connectivity:**

    Given this is the user's first app launch
    And the user has connectivity
    When the user requests to see the todo list feed
    Then the app should fetch the latest feed from the network
    And cache the feed for future offline use
    And display the tasks in the app


2. **On the first launch with no connectivity or network errors:**

    Given this is the user's first app launch
    And there are cached tasks available
    When the user requests to see the todo list feed
    Then the app should allow up to two retries for fetching the feed
    And if all retries fail, then the app should load tasks from the cached data
    And If the local cache is empty
    Then the user should see empty tasks list
    And allow the user to add new tasks manually


3. **On subsequent launches with connectivity or no connectivity:**

    Given this is not the user's first app launch
    And there are cached tasks available
    When the user requests to see the todo list feed
    Then the app should load tasks from the cached data
    And display them in the app


4. **On subsequent launches with no cached tasks:**

    Given this is not the user's first app launch
    And there are no cached tasks
    When the user requests to see the todo list feed
    Then the app should show the empty state screen
    And allow the user to add new tasks


---

### Narrative #2

As an offline customer
I want the app to show an empty todo list screen if no tasks are cached
So that I can add tasks even if I have no connectivity


#### Scenarios (Acceptance criteria):

1. **No cached tasks exist:**

    Given the user has already launched the app before
    And there is no cached tasks available
    And the user has no connectivity
    When the user requests to see the todo list feed
    Then the app should show the empty state screen
    And allow the user to add new tasks

## Use Case Flows

### Load Feed From Remote Use Case

#### Data:
- URL
- First app launch check

#### Primary course (happy path) - First App Launch:

1. Detect if this is the user's first app launch.
2. If yes:
    1. Execute **"Load Tasks Feed"** command from Remote with the URL.
    2. System downloads data from the network.
    3. System validates downloaded data.
    4. System caches the feed for future offline use.
    5. System delivers the tasks feed to the user interface.


### Alternate course (sad path) - Network Error on First Launch:
1. Detect if this is the user's first app launch.
2. If yes:
    1. Attempt to execute "Load Tasks Feed" command from Remote.
    2. If the network request fails:
        - Allow the user to retry up to two more times.
    3.If all retries fail:
    - Show the empty state screen.
    - Allow the user to add new tasks manually.
---

### Subsequent Launches:

1. If **not the first launch**:
    1. System checks if cached tasks exist.
2. If cached tasks are available:
    1. Load tasks from the cache.
    2. Deliver the feed to the user interface.
3. If no cached tasks are available:
    1. Show the empty state screen.
    2. Allow the user to add new tasks.

---

### Error Handling:

#### Invalid data response course (sad path):
1. System delivers invalid data error.

#### No connectivity or failed retries:
1. On first launch:
    - Allow up to two retry attempts to fetch data.
    - If retries fail, show the empty state screen and allow manual task creation.
2. On subsequent launches:
    - Load cached data or show the empty state as appropriate.

---

### Cache Feed Use Case

#### Primary course (happy path):
1. Execute **"Save Feed"** with tasks data.
2. System encodes task feed into the CoreData cache.
3. System saves the cache and confirms success.
